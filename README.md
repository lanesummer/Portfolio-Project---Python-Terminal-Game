# Portfolio-Project---Python-Terminal-Game
Codecademy Python Portfolio Project - create a terminal game using python

For my Portfolio Project using Python, I decided to create a 2-Player Tic-Tac-Toe game.
The players decide how many games they play. A running score of games won is kept.
Who will be the Tic-Tac-Toe champion?
